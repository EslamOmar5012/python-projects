# Hangman Game üïπÔ∏è

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Hangman** game. You will try to guess letters in a hidden word, and for every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman will be drawn. If the full hangman is drawn before you guess the word, you lose the game!

## üìù How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the Python script.
3. The game will select a random word from a word list.
4. You will be prompted to guess one letter at a time.
   - If you guess correctly, the letter will appear in its correct position in the word.
   - If you guess incorrectly, you lose one life, and part of the hangman will be drawn.
5. The game ends when:
   - You guess the entire word (you win).
   - You run out of lives and the hangman is fully drawn (you lose).
