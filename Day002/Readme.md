# Tip Calculator

Welcome to the Tip Calculator! This simple Python script helps you calculate the total amount each person needs to pay when splitting a bill, including tips. 

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The script prompts the user for three inputs:
   - The total bill amount.
   - The percentage tip they would like to give (10, 12, or 15).
   - The number of people to split the bill.

2. **Tip Calculation**: The script calculates the tip based on the total bill and the specified percentage.

3. **Total Bill Calculation**: It adds the calculated tip to the original bill to get the total amount that needs to be paid.

4. **Payment Per Person Calculation**: The script divides the total amount by the number of people to determine how much each person should pay.

5. **Output**: Finally, the script prints the amount each person should pay.
