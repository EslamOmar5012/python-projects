# Treasure Island Game

Welcome to the Treasure Island Game! This interactive text-based adventure allows you to embark on a quest to find treasure while making choices that will determine your fate. 

## How It Works

1. **Game Introduction**: The game starts with a welcome message and explains the mission to find the treasure.

2. **First Move**: You are presented with a choice at a crossroad:
   - Go "left" or "right".

3. **Second Move**: If you choose to go left, you arrive at a lake with the option to:
   - "wait" for a boat or "swim" across the lake.

4. **Third Move**: If you wait for the boat, you reach an island with a house that has three doors:
   - Choose between a red door, a yellow door, or a blue door.

5. **Outcomes**:
   - Each choice leads to different outcomes:
     - Going right or swimming leads to game over.
     - Choosing the red door or blue door also leads to game over.
     - Choosing the yellow door means you win the game!
